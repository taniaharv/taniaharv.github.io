                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>My name is Toffee and I was one of the Sweetie Gang.  That's me the cheeky one on the right of the picture.  There was four of us, two ginger boys - Toffee & Caramel, a ginger girl called Fudge and the odd one out a black boy called Liquorice.</p>
                    <p>We were found in a paper bale at a recycling depot.  No sign of our birth mum.</p>
                    <p>A man found us and took us home to his wife who did her best to hand-rear us but struggled and eventually contacted a rescue called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/508486362674789/" target="_blank"><strong>Rescue Kitties</strong></a>.</p>
                    <p>Rescue Kitties found us a new mummy called Tania.  We were her first hand-rears so she was a little nervous but having fostered a number of litters before, albeit with a cat mummy, she soon got into the swing of bottles, cleaning bums and all the other tasks cat mummies need to do.</p>
                    <p>Liquorice was the greediest kitten and always grabbed the milk bottles first.  Mummy worked out a way of feeding us two at a time and our foster daddy Ahmed also lent a hand.</p>
                    <p>We grew big and strong with out foster mummies love and care and eventually she found us all lovely homes and furever mummies and daddies.</p>              
                    <p>We can't thank Tania enough for looking after us so well as we would surely have died had someone not found us and got us the care we needed.</p>
                    <p>I know Tania still thinks of us often and we all still remember our foster mummy, she gave us such a great start in life. </p>
